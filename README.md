* In this project I wrote a Python script to automate a small town's vote-counting process.   

* The polling data is a csv file composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. 

* My Python script analyzes the votes and calculates the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
